    <h2>Export / Import</h2>
    <p>Every table has field (TableInfo field) containing DateTime stamp
      when table has been updated.<br>
      This field is useful to compare two tables, for example, two
      tables table1 and table2 are equal if they have<br>
      the same name and the same DateTime stamps.</p>
    <p>When tables are exported by using old data format or CSV format,
      then DateTime are not saved.<br>
      Therefore, when those tables are imported, then the new DateTime
      is assigned for every imported table.<br>
      Only in case of importing tables from files in Json format the
      saved there DateTime are restored for<br>
      every table.<br>
